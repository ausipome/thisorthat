It always starts with a simple question: **What do you actually need it for?** Because let’s be honest—we could all be tempted by powerful machines with top-end specs, but if you’re just checking emails and streaming Netflix, you really don’t need to spend £1,000+. On the other hand, if you’re editing videos or running complex code, you’ll want to invest where it matters most.
      
So here’s how I help you choose the best laptop for *you*—not for the shelf, not for the spec sheet, but for your actual life and budget.

## 🧠 Start With Your Use Case

I like to put laptops into a few categories. Each one has different needs—so here’s what I look for in each:

### 💻 Basic Use – Browsing, Email, Everyday Apps

Perfect for someone who just needs the essentials.

- **CPU:** Intel i3 or Ryzen 3 (or equivalent)
- **RAM:** 4GB minimum, 8GB ideal
- **Storage:** 128–256GB SSD
- **Extras:** Lightweight, good battery, decent screen

You don’t need bells and whistles—just reliability and speed for daily tasks.

### 🎓 Student – Notes, Video Calls, Multi-Tasking

Students need something portable, reliable, and fast enough to juggle apps.

- **CPU:** Intel i5 / Ryzen 5 or Apple M1/M2
- **RAM:** 8GB or more (16GB for heavier use)
- **Storage:** 256–512GB SSD
- **Extras:** Good webcam, solid keyboard, all-day battery

Weight matters if you're carrying it to classes every day.

### 🧑‍💼 Business – Office Work, Presentations, Multi-Screen

Productivity-focused but not always high performance.

- **CPU:** Intel i5/i7, Ryzen 5/7
- **RAM:** 16GB ideal
- **Storage:** 512GB+ SSD
- **Extras:** Great display for multitasking, fingerprint/face unlock, plenty of ports for docking

Battery life and reliability are key here—especially if you're often on the go.

### 🎨 Creative – Photo, Video, and Design Work

You’ll want something with power and precision.

- **CPU:** Intel i7/i9, Ryzen 7/9, or Apple M1 Pro/Max
- **RAM:** 16GB minimum, 32GB+ for pro workflows
- **Storage:** 1TB SSD preferred
- **Extras:** High-res color-accurate display, dedicated GPU, Thunderbolt or USB-C for fast transfers

This is where premium specs really matter. A great screen is just as important as the power under the hood.

### 👨‍💻 Developer – Coding, Compiling, Virtualization

You need speed, flexibility, and efficiency.

- **CPU:** Multi-core i5/i7, Ryzen 7, Apple Silicon
- **RAM:** 16GB+ (especially for running local servers or Docker)
- **Storage:** 512GB–1TB SSD
- **Extras:** High-res display, solid keyboard, Linux compatibility or virtualization support

Also consider upgradeability if you’re tinkering long-term.

### 🎮 Gamer – High Frame Rates, GPU, Thermals

Not just about power—it’s about *balanced* power.

- **CPU:** Intel i7/Ryzen 7 or higher
- **RAM:** 16GB minimum
- **Storage:** 512GB+ SSD + room for expansion
- **GPU:** RTX 3060 or better
- **Display:** 120Hz+ refresh rate, good cooling

Keep an eye on thermal design. If it runs hot, it won’t run well for long.

## ⚙️ Match the Right Specs

Once we’ve nailed your use case, we can make smarter decisions about where your budget should go. Don’t just look at numbers—match them to your *actual* needs.

## 💬 My Philosophy? Use Your Budget *Wisely*

It’s not about spending it all. It’s about spending it *right*. Sometimes the best laptop for you costs less than what you expected—and I love when that happens.

If you’re not sure where to start, just drop me a message (email or DM, links in footer). I’ll help you figure out your use case, match it to the best options, and make sure you walk away with something that feels like it was made for you.

Smart, simple, and personal. That’s how I do tech.
